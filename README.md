Food Donation Platform

This project is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate food donation and distribution, converting surplus food into accessible resources for those in need. The platform supports three primary user roles: donors, recipients, and riders, each integral to the seamless operation of the food donation process.

Donors:
Allows individuals and organizations to easily donate their surplus food.
Donors can list available food items with details such as type, quantity, and expiration date.
A user-friendly interface enables donors to schedule pickup times and view the real-time location of riders responsible for collecting the donations.

Recipients:
Food banks and NGOs can register on the platform to receive donated food.
Recipients can browse available food donations and request items that meet their needs.
Ensures that recipients are promptly notified about available donations and upcoming deliveries.

Riders:
Riders tasked with collecting and delivering donations have their real-time locations tracked and displayed to donors.
Enhances transparency and coordination, keeping donors informed about the status of their donations.
Riders can update their status and confirm successful deliveries through the platform.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React or Angular)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (or another backend framework)
Database: MongoDB (or another database system)
